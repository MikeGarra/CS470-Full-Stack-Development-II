CS 470 Full Stack Development II: Final Reflection
YouTube: https://youtu.be/7dc6PSJPJg8

Experiences and Strengths:
•	What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

During my time working in this course, I have better developed my skills with debugging issues that came up in the programming of my assignments. I learned how to properly use Docker’s system and how to build images as well as compose those images into containers. I learned how to navigate through AWS and build a Full Stack application that allowed for a user to create questions, create answers, delete those questions and answers, and to edit them as well.

•	Describe your strengths as a software developer.
As a developer my strengths are paying close attention to detail and understanding that there is a reason for why something is not working and to back track through the steps I have taken to debug the issue and fix it. I truly enjoy the creativity that comes with developing and the critical thinking that is needed to debug an application to get it to properly run.

•	Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
The roles that I am prepared to assume in a new career are Cloud Based Applications and Full Stack Development.

Planning for Growth:
•	Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future. Consider the following:

	How would you handle scale and error handling?
I would handle scale and error handling through Event-driven Architectures. This style uses events and asynchronous communication to couple an applications components.

	How would you predict the cost?
The use of AWS Cost Calculator would help with predicting costs. As well as understanding the current usage I am performing with Lambda functions.

	What is more cost predictable, containers or serverless?
Containers are more cost predictable because they have a base set price while serverless is charged per request being executed.

•	What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?
Elasticity refers to the cloud systems ability to scale its resources automatically based on the level of demand, and pay-for-service plan is that you pay for the service when the request is executed.
